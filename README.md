# 🕵️ Secret Auction Program (Python)

## 📌 Description
This is a simple Python console-based Secret Auction program where multiple users can place bids anonymously. After all bids are entered, the program determines the highest bidder and displays the winner.

This project was created to practice basic Python programming concepts.
